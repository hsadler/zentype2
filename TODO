- brainstorm app items, tables and schema, architectures
	- user
	- word
	- typing_test
	- achievments

- build basic user login
	- user table
	- authentication backend architecture
		- jwt tokens (in cache?, need to research)
		- limit some API endpoints to authed users
		- consider other authentication problems
			- ex. user should only be able to edit their information and no one
				elses
	- authentication web client architecture
		- limit some pages to authed users

- build WPM typing test
	- get_wpm_typing_test() GET endpoint
		- possible params: difficulty, test length
		- fetch words from db
		- build test and return
		- perhaps store pending tests in db or cache
		- choose whether or not test results calculations are done on FE or BE
	- submit_wpm_typing_test() POST endpoint
		- send all words and timings
		- store test_result with user_id
		- think about ways to prevent forged requests cheating

- build user profile
	- user status, activity, achievements
	- summary of user test stats
	- graphs of progress
	- test history
	- test are viewable with granular information display

- build user community
	- profiles of other users are viewable
	- other users can be followed/friended
